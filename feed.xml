I have used Maya and 3DMax in my younger years but I recall nothing. I stayed with Blender because I believe in open source and it's a fantastic tool for 3D purposes.</p>
<p>In my wildest dream, I want the player to be able to surf on high dunes and also at night.</p>
<p>I remember an experience I had in my camping days. It was almost sunset and I needed to set up my camping. I spent more time than I needed in finding a place because the dunes were so precious. I ended up settling in a valley surrounded by dunes 😊😊😊</p>

<p>Atlas, however, experienced a desperate and forced solitude. Not only that, it was just a kid finding her way on a desert planet. How will I manage to do that... <em>I wonder</em>.</p>
<p>These samples are more like for display. I have no idea how I'm going to integrate that as the landscape in the game. </p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>While writing <strong>Viatorem, </strong>I noticed that I was still hyper-hyped with <strong>OÜ, </strong>the language I will use across the stories of my Cosmos. I found <strong>OÜ</strong>... as I needed to remember it. And suddenly, when I sat down to type more about <strong>Viatorem</strong> story I started to have this vision of the <em>AI</em> that <strong>Viatorem</strong>'s spaceship will have. One thing led to another and I ended up coding a tiny engine that uses quantum randomness to do a tarot draw. I called <strong>KOIMON.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, the name started to be a tribute to<strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/"> koimoons</a> </strong>but then everything started to fit without any effort. I needed a fictional AI that would be a companion to Viatorem on her travels. I also wanted that such AI has an intimate knowledge of the spaceship like it was the spaceship itself. The final touch I wanted to add was that I needed the spaceship to have a sort of hardware/software engine that tunes itself in the fabric of the Cosmos and provides information to <strong>Viatorem</strong>, like an oracle. Then, the name KOIMON came to mind</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong data-start="405" data-end="427">Japanese "Koi" (鯉)</strong> – The koi fish symbolizes <strong data-start="454" data-end="499">perseverance, transformation, and <em>destiny</em></strong>.<br data-start="500" data-end="503">In mythology, koi swim upstream and become dragons—perfect for a being that evolves and awakens.</p>
<p><em>Destiny. </em>Exactly what I was looking for 😍😍😍</p>
<p class="msg msg--success align-center"><strong>K</strong><em>nowledge<br></em><strong>O</strong><em>perating</em><br><strong>I</strong><em>nterface</em><br><strong>MON</strong><em>itor<br></em></p>
<p>After that, I started to get this visions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if <strong>KOIMON</strong> is a system that taps into quantum randomness to gather information that is codified?</em></li>
<li><em>What if we integrate mystical stuff into the story like the <strong>tarot</strong>?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I started to remember the <a href="https://noosphere.princeton.edu/">Global Consciousness Project</a> and then <a href="https://www.randonautica.app/">Randonautica</a>. So I said</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wait a second, what if I use a Quantum Random Number Generator for my own experiments?</em></li>
<li><em>I can map the numbers to a prime number and then a prime number represents a tarot card!</em></li>
<li><em>What if <strong>KOIMON</strong> is an interface that provides intimate knowledge of what could be through a tarot reading!?</em></li>
<li>HOLD ON... I can actually do that! Not just for the story BUT actually code the engine!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯</li>
</ul>
<p>Lo and behold, an hour later I had <strong>KOIMON. </strong>I tested it out with my own questions. I asked one of my closest friend to test it out and it <em>dogdamned</em> work!!</p>
<p>Yesterday was a crazy day... I felt I was living my own story...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>am I becoming Viatorem!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, the name of the spaceship is <em><strong>no.XIX</strong></em></p>

                <p>One of things I enjoy the most is connecting my stories under the same Cosmos. One may think the stories might take place in a different universe but in fact it is all under the same <strong>Cosmos</strong>. I was looking for a dimension to unify them all. Then it dawned on me: <em><strong>language</strong></em>.</p>
<h3>Core Principles of the Cosmological Visual Language: <span style="color: #843fa1;"><em><strong>OÜ</strong></em></span></h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>OÜ</strong> <em>cannot</em> be taught. It must be <strong><em data-start="3642" data-end="3654">remembered</em></strong>.<br data-start="3655" data-end="3658">Its true form changes depending on <strong><em data-start="3695" data-end="3708">who you are</em></strong> when you try to <em>read</em> or <em>write</em> it.</p>
<p><strong data-start="460" data-end="488">Resonance Over Precision</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li data-start="491" data-end="532">Each symbol doesn’t have a fixed meaning</li>
<li data-start="535" data-end="580">It evokes a <strong><em data-start="547" data-end="556">feeling</em>, <em data-start="558" data-end="566">memory</em>, or <em data-start="571" data-end="579">energy</em></strong></li>
<li data-start="535" data-end="580">Observants don’t <em>translate</em> it — they <strong><em data-start="619" data-end="627">attune</em></strong> to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I think reality is a relation, it makes sense that everything since filters out by the being in question. It won't be precise but it would be close enough to full communication which I believe is impossible.</p>
<p><strong data-start="643" data-end="666">Contextual Shifting</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li class="" data-start="667" data-end="724">
<p class="" data-start="669" data-end="724">Symbols change meaning depending on what’s around them</p>
</li>
<li data-start="727" data-end="818">Like in dreams: <em>the same shape means different things depending on time, color, proximity and being's history</em></li>
</ul>
<p data-start="820" data-end="848"><strong data-start="827" data-end="848">Synesthetic Logic</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Meanings are tied to <em data-start="872" data-end="895"><strong>senses</strong> and <strong>sensations</strong></em>, not categories:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong data-start="917" data-end="928">Spirals</strong> may feel like warmth or expansion</li>
<li><strong data-start="968" data-end="984">Jagged forms</strong> could induce discomfort or transformation</li>
<li><strong data-start="1032" data-end="1048">Color shifts</strong> might signal emotional states or time passage</li>
<li><em><strong data-start="1100" data-end="1112">Textures</strong></em> could indicate truth, lies, memories, or hidden layers (<em><strong>???)</strong></em></li>

It's easier to be cynical about it but in retrospective I don't blame my parents, they were too young to know what to do.<em> Does anyone of any change know what to do to be a good parent?</em></p>
<p>I was a sensible kid. Very sensible kid. There were times were I cried and crouched like a baby because of the pain. I don't think it was a physical pain but for some reason that's how my body reacted. I was not an effeminate kid but I was quite sensible. My dad noticed that. In his defense, he saw a kid who clearly would be eaten by the world. So he did he thought best. He tried to make me a man in ways that clearly didn't work. It only made me feel a shame of myself. I wanted to learn to dance like a ballerina. My great grand mother was a famous ballerina in the early 1900s. She travelled the world and such and such. But for a kid to do that and knowing what I was, he, well, didn't allowed that. </p>

Only my grand mother let me be. I grew as a kid who couldn't be himself for most of time among other issue. </p>
<p>I tried to draw and that was alright. I did for years. But something inside me was dying. It's been hmm more than a decade since I haven't drawn anything. During college I made music. Not fancy music but good enough for me. </p>
<p>I remember that at some point I gave a friend a gift. I wrapped it up with my last drawings. To me they were normal. But for him, he found them fascinating. He framed one of the drawings. It is as we speak hanging in his apartment. I never thought <em>my art</em> would be part of personal art gallery of anybody 🥺🥺🥺</p>

I just wanted a place to create my stuff. Since then I stopped being artistic in any way. No music, no drawings, no dancing.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what happened inside me. I tried for a second time to create a sort of a studio but more flexible and such. But the issues the economy (<em>and someone else</em>), I run out of money.</p>
<p>Recently, I have a video call with a friend who happens to also be writing children books. After that talk I felt I needed to go back to my roots. There are other major reasons but, for respect to the person involved, I can't say more.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I was good at anything. I'm merely saying that I had something in me that allow to draw, dance and make music and it got lost. I lost it. I blame no one.</p>

I've been doodling daily. I need to go back. This time, though, I 'm aiming high: I want to find a way to illustrate as far as I can get close to the lord and master <a href="https://www.moebius.fr/"><strong>Moebiüs</strong></a> style. I need that for my projects. Obviously, I don't want to be like him or draw like him but similar beautiful landscape with my own style.</p>
<p>I have no idea how what I will accomplish. I'm certainly crazy in wanting my projects to succeed when I'm mostly alone and rusty skills but hey the impossibility of things has never been an impediment for <em>moi.</em></p>

<p>Ain't consider myself an expert on anything. I'm more like an observant, a very curious person. I'm not interested in being judgemental but rather know more about anything. When it comes to writing or any creative process, my way to go is to be surrounded by things that project you into those scenarios.</p>
<p>I just realized that I have become, in a way, <strong><em>Viatorem</em></strong>. I think that's why I fell in love with that character. I'm in my house at 6am working with Lola, a tiny bunny. I recently pierced my ears again and the design I chose is like a representation of hey eyes. I started to see my home as a spaceship. In the afternoons, I take a break and start dancing in the open space I have. <em><strong>Viatorem</strong>'s</em> adventure will always start with a song and her dancing in her spaceship. I'm living in a desert city and I love the desert.</p>
<p>I have in front of me, for lack of a better word, a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, I intentionally but also subconsciously did it.</p>
<p>What I find very interesting is that <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>was not my creation. She was created by <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>. Now I find myself not being able to live without her. Don't get me wrong. I love <strong>Atlas</strong>' story. I created her. She's in my room as we speak but <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>seems to fulfill a very old dream: <strong>to travel the Cosmos and have space adventures</strong>, <em>my own personal space opera</em>.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for what my life has become especially with this forsaken global situation.</p>

                <p>I touch many subjects in my stories. Some of my friends are surprised by the subjects I choose to write about. As an example, I'm utterly and completely terrified about <em><strong>immortality.</strong></em></p>
<p>While I write stories, either in my head or on paper, most of the ideas are sad but profound subjects when it comes to human existence. From time to time, I add happy moments, just like life. </p>
<p>Like any artistic person, I, for one, believe during the process of creating, more ideas get downloaded. Recently, I came up with a tiny little story in the form of a rhyme. This is clearly a projection of my fear. I don't think immortality is a good idea. So I imagine we have a choice. The following is a possible scenario in the form of rhymed storytelling, if you will</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195"><strong>The Simple But Sad Story of Mr. Feinberg</strong></p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195">Mr. Feinberg, you learned it true<br data-start="65" data-end="68">Immortality stays—consciousness grew<br data-start="109" data-end="112">Yet love once cherished passed away<br data-start="152" data-end="155">And none remain to light your way</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="197" data-end="367">Mr. Feinberg, what will you do?<br data-start="232" data-end="235">She drifts where stars shine cold and blue<br data-start="282" data-end="285">The Cosmos swells, it pulls apart<br data-start="323" data-end="326">No matter time, no bridge to heart</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="369" data-end="525">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, you may choose<br data-start="407" data-end="410">To let it end, to cut it loose<br data-start="445" data-end="448">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, pain won't fade<br data-start="487" data-end="490">Eternal life—a cruel charade</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="527" data-end="672">A final mezcal, a sunset’s glow<br data-start="563" data-end="566">A whisper soft, a last shadow<br data-start="600" data-end="603">Mr. Feinberg, you cease to be<br data-start="637" data-end="640">No longer bound to memory</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="674" data-end="839">Here lies the tale, somber and deep<br data-start="714" data-end="717">A man whose love refused to sleep<br data-start="755" data-end="758">Even in death, it held on tight<br data-start="794" data-end="797">A love that burned beyond the night</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="841" data-end="926">Rest in peace, dear friend so true<br data-start="880" data-end="883"><em>Immortality</em> was bittersweet with <em>you<br></em></p>

                <p>I used the tarot. There is no point on denying that. And, to my luck, it has been so helpful and terrifying.</p>
<p>In 3 reading sessions, my interpretation, it was that there will be someone in the future that will help me be accountable, supportive but not in a collaborative way. </p>
<p>I didn't understand those readings. It asked me to be patience, that it will come.</p>
<p>Those reading happened after, <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>, the <em>illustrator, </em>so I knew it wasn't her.</p>
<p>Why is that impressive? Well, it also said that it will be someone from my past 😨😨😨</p>
<p>At those moments, I could thought of anyone.</p>
<p>Weeks past, and nothing. But I needed to be patience, it said or rather I understood that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, finally, I have a casual meeting with a friend. He's living in Brooklyn now. He is one of those artistic people I admire so much. I don't know why I didn't think of him before. In my defense, I think I didn't think of him 'cuz he's always doing something artistic plus work. Internally, I guess I knew he wouldn't have the time.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, we now have every Sunday meeting of what we called <em>Creative Anonymous Support Group.</em> He is also writing children books!</p>
<p class="align-center">😳😳😳<br>🤯🤯🤯</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>I'm so happy for this support. I really needed. It's like traveling the Cosmos totally alone and it feels nice that through intercom there is something in the Cosmos doing something similar.</em></p>

<p>I recently finished a very long bug we had at my place work. It was very demoralizing bug. Debug mode was added by a co-worker, I have no idea what would have been without it.</p>
<p>It took me months, around 7 months. During that time I took detours to gain some morale. By the end of the road, taking detour was destroying my soul. I even took vacation days and didn't work.</p>
<p>But finally, I managed to fix it perhaps I'm romanticizing the whole thing after all 🦁🦁🦁. I did make progress along the way but that didn't help with my morale.</p>
<p>For <strong><em>Crystal Children, </em></strong>I'm adding some debug information. I'm pretty sure I'll mess up the performance and such 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨</p>
