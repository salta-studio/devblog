                <p>One of things I enjoy the most is connecting my stories under the same Cosmos. One may think the stories might take place in a different universe but in fact it is all under the same <strong>Cosmos</strong>. I was looking for a dimension to unify them all. Then it dawned on me: <em><strong>language</strong></em>.</p>
<h3>Core Principles of the Cosmological Visual Language: <span style="color: #843fa1;"><em><strong>OÜ</strong></em></span></h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>OÜ</strong> <em>cannot</em> be taught. It must be <strong><em data-start="3642" data-end="3654">remembered</em></strong>.<br data-start="3655" data-end="3658">Its true form changes depending on <strong><em data-start="3695" data-end="3708">who you are</em></strong> when you try to <em>read</em> or <em>write</em> it.</p>
<p><strong data-start="460" data-end="488">Resonance Over Precision</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li data-start="491" data-end="532">Each symbol doesn’t have a fixed meaning</li>
<li data-start="535" data-end="580">It evokes a <strong><em data-start="547" data-end="556">feeling</em>, <em data-start="558" data-end="566">memory</em>, or <em data-start="571" data-end="579">energy</em></strong></li>
<li data-start="535" data-end="580">Observants don’t <em>translate</em> it — they <strong><em data-start="619" data-end="627">attune</em></strong> to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I think reality is a relation, it makes sense that everything since filters out by the being in question. It won't be precise but it would be close enough to full communication which I believe is impossible.</p>
<p><strong data-start="643" data-end="666">Contextual Shifting</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li class="" data-start="667" data-end="724">
<p class="" data-start="669" data-end="724">Symbols change meaning depending on what’s around them</p>
</li>
<li data-start="727" data-end="818">Like in dreams: <em>the same shape means different things depending on time, color, proximity and being's history</em></li>
</ul>
<p data-start="820" data-end="848"><strong data-start="827" data-end="848">Synesthetic Logic</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Meanings are tied to <em data-start="872" data-end="895"><strong>senses</strong> and <strong>sensations</strong></em>, not categories:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><strong data-start="917" data-end="928">Spirals</strong> may feel like warmth or expansion</li>
<li><strong data-start="968" data-end="984">Jagged forms</strong> could induce discomfort or transformation</li>
<li><strong data-start="1032" data-end="1048">Color shifts</strong> might signal emotional states or time passage</li>
<li><em><strong data-start="1100" data-end="1112">Textures</strong></em> could indicate truth, lies, memories, or hidden layers (<em><strong>???)</strong></em></li>
</ul>

It's easier to be cynical about it but in retrospective I don't blame my parents, they were too young to know what to do.<em> Does anyone of any change know what to do to be a good parent?</em></p>
<p>I was a sensible kid. Very sensible kid. There were times were I cried and crouched like a baby because of the pain. I don't think it was a physical pain but for some reason that's how my body reacted. I was not an effeminate kid but I was quite sensible. My dad noticed that. In his defense, he saw a kid who clearly would be eaten by the world. So he did he thought best. He tried to make me a man in ways that clearly didn't work. It only made me feel a shame of myself. I wanted to learn to dance like a ballerina. My great grand mother was a famous ballerina in the early 1900s. She travelled the world and such and such. But for a kid to do that and knowing what I was, he, well, didn't allowed that. </p>

Only my grand mother let me be. I grew as a kid who couldn't be himself for most of time among other issue. </p>
<p>I tried to draw and that was alright. I did for years. But something inside me was dying. It's been hmm more than a decade since I haven't drawn anything. During college I made music. Not fancy music but good enough for me. </p>
<p>I remember that at some point I gave a friend a gift. I wrapped it up with my last drawings. To me they were normal. But for him, he found them fascinating. He framed one of the drawings. It is as we speak hanging in his apartment. I never thought <em>my art</em> would be part of personal art gallery of anybody 🥺🥺🥺</p>

I just wanted a place to create my stuff. Since then I stopped being artistic in any way. No music, no drawings, no dancing.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what happened inside me. I tried for a second time to create a sort of a studio but more flexible and such. But the issues the economy (<em>and someone else</em>), I run out of money.</p>
<p>Recently, I have a video call with a friend who happens to also be writing children books. After that talk I felt I needed to go back to my roots. There are other major reasons but, for respect to the person involved, I can't say more.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I was good at anything. I'm merely saying that I had something in me that allow to draw, dance and make music and it got lost. I lost it. I blame no one.</p>

I've been doodling daily. I need to go back. This time, though, I 'm aiming high: I want to find a way to illustrate as far as I can get close to the lord and master <a href="https://www.moebius.fr/"><strong>Moebiüs</strong></a> style. I need that for my projects. Obviously, I don't want to be like him or draw like him but similar beautiful landscape with my own style.</p>
<p>I have no idea how what I will accomplish. I'm certainly crazy in wanting my projects to succeed when I'm mostly alone and rusty skills but hey the impossibility of things has never been an impediment for <em>moi.</em></p>

<p>Ain't consider myself an expert on anything. I'm more like an observant, a very curious person. I'm not interested in being judgemental but rather know more about anything. When it comes to writing or any creative process, my way to go is to be surrounded by things that project you into those scenarios.</p>
<p>I just realized that I have become, in a way, <strong><em>Viatorem</em></strong>. I think that's why I fell in love with that character. I'm in my house at 6am working with Lola, a tiny bunny. I recently pierced my ears again and the design I chose is like a representation of hey eyes. I started to see my home as a spaceship. In the afternoons, I take a break and start dancing in the open space I have. <em><strong>Viatorem</strong>'s</em> adventure will always start with a song and her dancing in her spaceship. I'm living in a desert city and I love the desert.</p>
<p>I have in front of me, for lack of a better word, a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, I intentionally but also subconsciously did it.</p>
<p>What I find very interesting is that <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>was not my creation. She was created by <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>. Now I find myself not being able to live without her. Don't get me wrong. I love <strong>Atlas</strong>' story. I created her. She's in my room as we speak but <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>seems to fulfill a very old dream: <strong>to travel the Cosmos and have space adventures</strong>, <em>my own personal space opera</em>.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for what my life has become especially with this forsaken global situation.</p>

                <p>I touch many subjects in my stories. Some of my friends are surprised by the subjects I choose to write about. As an example, I'm utterly and completely terrified about <em><strong>immortality.</strong></em></p>
<p>While I write stories, either in my head or on paper, most of the ideas are sad but profound subjects when it comes to human existence. From time to time, I add happy moments, just like life. </p>
<p>Like any artistic person, I, for one, believe during the process of creating, more ideas get downloaded. Recently, I came up with a tiny little story in the form of a rhyme. This is clearly a projection of my fear. I don't think immortality is a good idea. So I imagine we have a choice. The following is a possible scenario in the form of rhymed storytelling, if you will</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195"><strong>The Simple But Sad Story of Mr. Feinberg</strong></p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195">Mr. Feinberg, you learned it true<br data-start="65" data-end="68">Immortality stays—consciousness grew<br data-start="109" data-end="112">Yet love once cherished passed away<br data-start="152" data-end="155">And none remain to light your way</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="197" data-end="367">Mr. Feinberg, what will you do?<br data-start="232" data-end="235">She drifts where stars shine cold and blue<br data-start="282" data-end="285">The Cosmos swells, it pulls apart<br data-start="323" data-end="326">No matter time, no bridge to heart</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="369" data-end="525">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, you may choose<br data-start="407" data-end="410">To let it end, to cut it loose<br data-start="445" data-end="448">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, pain won't fade<br data-start="487" data-end="490">Eternal life—a cruel charade</p>

                <p>I used the tarot. There is no point on denying that. And, to my luck, it has been so helpful and terrifying.</p>
<p>In 3 reading sessions, my interpretation, it was that there will be someone in the future that will help me be accountable, supportive but not in a collaborative way. </p>
<p>I didn't understand those readings. It asked me to be patience, that it will come.</p>
<p>Those reading happened after, <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>, the <em>illustrator, </em>so I knew it wasn't her.</p>
<p>Why is that impressive? Well, it also said that it will be someone from my past 😨😨😨</p>
<p>At those moments, I could thought of anyone.</p>
<p>Weeks past, and nothing. But I needed to be patience, it said or rather I understood that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, finally, I have a casual meeting with a friend. He's living in Brooklyn now. He is one of those artistic people I admire so much. I don't know why I didn't think of him before. In my defense, I think I didn't think of him 'cuz he's always doing something artistic plus work. Internally, I guess I knew he wouldn't have the time.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, we now have every Sunday meeting of what we called <em>Creative Anonymous Support Group.</em> He is also writing children books!</p>
<p class="align-center">😳😳😳<br>🤯🤯🤯</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>I'm so happy for this support. I really needed. It's like traveling the Cosmos totally alone and it feels nice that through intercom there is something in the Cosmos doing something similar.</em></p>

<p>Yes, you play the character, <strong><em>Atlas. </em></strong>However, I think what I want from the<em> player </em>is to experience solitude but also adventure while playing in the desert.</p>
<p>I want the <em>player</em> to feel awe while sliding through the dunes at night.</p>
<p>I want the player to feel lost and at the same time to have hope for the future.</p>
<p>I want the player to be in the world and feel part of it, part of the world and not separate from it.</p>
<p>Is that a video game? I have no idea. I have played a few games that didn't feel like a game but rather a cinematographic experience.</p>

<p>I recently finished a very long bug we had at my place work. It was very demoralizing bug. Debug mode was added by a co-worker, I have no idea what would have been without it.</p>
<p>It took me months, around 7 months. During that time I took detours to gain some morale. By the end of the road, taking detour was destroying my soul. I even took vacation days and didn't work.</p>
<p>But finally, I managed to fix it perhaps I'm romanticizing the whole thing after all 🦁🦁🦁. I did make progress along the way but that didn't help with my morale.</p>
<p>For <strong><em>Crystal Children, </em></strong>I'm adding some debug information. I'm pretty sure I'll mess up the performance and such 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨</p>

<p>Tengo la premisa y el final del puppet show que llamo <strong>Dr. Naríz y sus Demonios.</strong></p>
<p>Tengo una vaga idea de cómo será su físico aunque involucra mucho espuma y soporte. Definitivamente su mecánica no será la misma que un puppet tradiciona<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">l. Solo se moverá el bigote. De los anteojos aún no estoy seguro.</span></p>
<p>La idea de este show me llegó en un viaje con DMT. Me topé en un lugar donde todo era muy oscuro.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  style="margin-bottom: 1.37143rem; margin-right: 1.37143rem; color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.55) !important;" src="https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/5/drnariz.png" alt="" width="224" height="207" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/5/responsive/drnariz-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/5/responsive/drnariz-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/5/responsive/drnariz-md.webp 768w"></figure>
<p>Sentía la vibración de miedo y logré ver <em>demonios</em> por darles un nombre. Sentía como querían que tuviera miedo pero sentí como algo me tocaba el hombro solo sentía paz. En ese momento entendí o me hicieron entender que todo está bien que no había razón de temer. Me llegó el pensamiento que <em>algo es bueno o malo</em>, <em>las cosas solo son y cada ser es un mundo complejo</em>. <em>Que hacer un juicio era muy injusto</em>. Después de un rato regresé. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/5/Trim-GIF-from-Personal-Mail.GIF" alt="" width="282" height="500"></figure>Después de varios días e integración de lo que viví. Me llegó esa idea. ¿Qué tal si hay un psicólogo interdimensional que da terapia a los demonios? ¿Qué tal si esos demonios tiene crisis existencial y quieren integrar su luz? Vamos, así como los humanos intentan integrar su sombra, pensé <em>¿por qué no ellos integran su luz?</em>  y así nació <strong>Dr. Naríz y sus Demonios</strong>.</p>
<p>He estado aprendiendo y practicando el arte de los puppets. Me topé con una gran comunidad a nivel mundial. <em>Definitivamente Jim dejó el planeta un poco mejor.</em></p>
<p>Hasta el momento he aprendido que</p>
<ul>
<li>El material es importante, especial mente la espuma.
<ul>
<li>Hay diferentes tipos y cada una sirve un propósito en particular</li>
<li>Depende donde vivas, es difícil conseguirlas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patrones. Los cortes para el esqueleto y el pelaje/piel depende mucho de que deseas lograr.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiosamente no me he topado con una herramienta que tome un modelo 3D y lo haga polígono para recortar. Veo una área de oportunidad para hacer un software open source para la comunidad 🥰</p>

                <p>I'm writing in my bed. It's 8:18pm. I'm listening to <a href="https://musicforprogramming.net/three"><em>Episode 03: Datassette</em></a>. I just finished some tasks with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> about a game I'm doing as a sandbox to learn the ups and downs of <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. Before that I was writing <strong>Viatorem</strong>: <em>Crystal Children. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, </em>they say. </p>
<p>I'm looking into the future of all things I'm creating and it's dawning on me... this ain't going to be easy. Nothing that I don't know already. But jeez... when you pull yourself out and see everything as a third party, <em>fork me sideways</em>.</p>
<p>To provide some context</p>
<ul>
<li>I wake up at 4:30am.</li>
<li>Prepare curcumin, moringa and green tea with cacao.</li>
<li>Slice a garlic clove to eat.</li>
<li>Sometimes I take a cold bath.</li>
<li>I start working at 5:00 am.</li>
<li>I take breaks of 20 mins.</li>
<li>I close work at 5:00 pm.</li>
<li>I take walks, in sum, I need to cover 12km which is usually around two hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>So from 7pm to 11pm is my working hours to do what I love.</p>
<p>I don't need to work a lot so I'm doing some changes so I can work from 2pm to 11pm on my stuff. <em>Discipline is your ally.</em></p>
<p>I'm lucky enough to be strict with me. Sometimes I think I enjoy suffering. In my defense, I like to push my limits whenever I can.</p>
<p><em>The expected journey is what it is: all the great things in life require sacrifices... </em>There is no escape and I'm certainly not the exception. Passion and love goes out the window as time passes.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>focus, commitment and sheer will</em> is what keeps you going... <strong><em>I</em><em>n life, love, and work...</em></strong></p>
<p><em>To the struggle 🍻</em></p>
