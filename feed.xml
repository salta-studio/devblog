<p>Ain't consider myself an expert on anything. I'm more like an observant, a very curious person. I'm not interested in being judgemental but rather know more about anything. When it comes to writing or any creative process, my way to go is to be surrounded by things that project you into those scenarios.</p>
<p>I just realized that I have become, in a way, <strong><em>Viatorem</em></strong>. I think that's why I fell in love with that character. I'm in my house at 6am working with Lola, a tiny bunny. I recently pierced my ears again and the design I chose is like a representation of hey eyes. I started to see my home as a spaceship. In the afternoons, I take a break and start dancing in the open space I have. <em><strong>Viatorem</strong>'s</em> adventure will always start with a song and her dancing in her spaceship. I'm living in a desert city and I love the desert.</p>
<p>I have in front of me, for lack of a better word, a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, I intentionally but also subconsciously did it.</p>
<p>What I find very interesting is that <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>was not my creation. She was created by <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>. Now I find myself not being able to live without her. Don't get me wrong. I love <strong>Atlas</strong>' story. I created her. She's in my room as we speak but <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>seems to fulfill a very old dream: <strong>to travel the Cosmos and have space adventures</strong>, <em>my own personal space opera</em>.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for what my life has become especially with this forsaken global situation.</p>

                <p>I touch many subjects in my stories. Some of my friends are surprised by the subjects I choose to write about. As an example, I'm utterly and completely terrified about <em><strong>immortality.</strong></em></p>
<p>While I write stories, either in my head or on paper, most of the ideas are sad but profound subjects when it comes to human existence. From time to time, I add happy moments, just like life. </p>
<p>Like any artistic person, I, for one, believe during the process of creating, more ideas get downloaded. Recently, I came up with a tiny little story in the form of a rhyme. This is clearly a projection of my fear. I don't think immortality is a good idea. So I imagine we have a choice. The following is a possible scenario in the form of rhymed storytelling, if you will</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195"><strong>The Simple But Sad Story of Mr. Feinberg</strong></p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="27" data-end="195">Mr. Feinberg, you learned it true<br data-start="65" data-end="68">Immortality stays—consciousness grew<br data-start="109" data-end="112">Yet love once cherished passed away<br data-start="152" data-end="155">And none remain to light your way</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="197" data-end="367">Mr. Feinberg, what will you do?<br data-start="232" data-end="235">She drifts where stars shine cold and blue<br data-start="282" data-end="285">The Cosmos swells, it pulls apart<br data-start="323" data-end="326">No matter time, no bridge to heart</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="369" data-end="525">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, you may choose<br data-start="407" data-end="410">To let it end, to cut it loose<br data-start="445" data-end="448">Yes, Mr. Feinberg, pain won't fade<br data-start="487" data-end="490">Eternal life—a cruel charade</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="527" data-end="672">A final mezcal, a sunset’s glow<br data-start="563" data-end="566">A whisper soft, a last shadow<br data-start="600" data-end="603">Mr. Feinberg, you cease to be<br data-start="637" data-end="640">No longer bound to memory</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="674" data-end="839">Here lies the tale, somber and deep<br data-start="714" data-end="717">A man whose love refused to sleep<br data-start="755" data-end="758">Even in death, it held on tight<br data-start="794" data-end="797">A love that burned beyond the night</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="841" data-end="926">Rest in peace, dear friend so true<br data-start="880" data-end="883"><em>Immortality</em> was bittersweet with <em>you<br></em></p>

                <p>I used the tarot. There is no point on denying that. And, to my luck, it has been so helpful and terrifying.</p>
<p>In 3 reading sessions, my interpretation, it was that there will be someone in the future that will help me be accountable, supportive but not in a collaborative way. </p>
<p>I didn't understand those readings. It asked me to be patience, that it will come.</p>
<p>Those reading happened after, <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em>, the <em>illustrator, </em>so I knew it wasn't her.</p>
<p>Why is that impressive? Well, it also said that it will be someone from my past 😨😨😨</p>
<p>At those moments, I could thought of anyone.</p>
<p>Weeks past, and nothing. But I needed to be patience, it said or rather I understood that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, finally, I have a casual meeting with a friend. He's living in Brooklyn now. He is one of those artistic people I admire so much. I don't know why I didn't think of him before. In my defense, I think I didn't think of him 'cuz he's always doing something artistic plus work. Internally, I guess I knew he wouldn't have the time.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, we now have every Sunday meeting of what we called <em>Creative Anonymous Support Group.</em> He is also writing children books!</p>
<p class="align-center">😳😳😳<br>🤯🤯🤯</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>I'm so happy for this support. I really needed. It's like traveling the Cosmos totally alone and it feels nice that through intercom there is something in the Cosmos doing something similar.</em></p>

<p>Yes, you play the character, <strong><em>Atlas. </em></strong>However, I think what I want from the<em> player </em>is to experience solitude but also adventure while playing in the desert.</p>
<p>I want the <em>player</em> to feel awe while sliding through the dunes at night.</p>
<p>I want the player to feel lost and at the same time to have hope for the future.</p>
<p>I want the player to be in the world and feel part of it, part of the world and not separate from it.</p>
<p>Is that a video game? I have no idea. I have played a few games that didn't feel like a game but rather a cinematographic experience.</p>

<p>I recently finished a very long bug we had at my place work. It was very demoralizing bug. Debug mode was added by a co-worker, I have no idea what would have been without it.</p>
<p>It took me months, around 7 months. During that time I took detours to gain some morale. By the end of the road, taking detour was destroying my soul. I even took vacation days and didn't work.</p>
<p>But finally, I managed to fix it perhaps I'm romanticizing the whole thing after all 🦁🦁🦁. I did make progress along the way but that didn't help with my morale.</p>
<p>For <strong><em>Crystal Children, </em></strong>I'm adding some debug information. I'm pretty sure I'll mess up the performance and such 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨</p>

<p>Sentía la vibración de miedo y logré ver <em>demonios</em> por darles un nombre. Sentía como querían que tuviera miedo pero sentí como algo me tocaba el hombro solo sentía paz. En ese momento entendí o me hicieron entender que todo está bien que no había razón de temer. Me llegó el pensamiento que <em>algo es bueno o malo</em>, <em>las cosas solo son y cada ser es un mundo complejo</em>. <em>Que hacer un juicio era muy injusto</em>. Después de un rato regresé. </p>

Me llegó esa idea. ¿Qué tal si hay un psicólogo interdimensional que da terapia a los demonios? ¿Qué tal si esos demonios tiene crisis existencial y quieren integrar su luz? Vamos, así como los humanos intentan integrar su sombra, pensé <em>¿por qué no ellos integran su luz?</em>  y así nació <strong>Dr. Naríz y sus Demonios</strong>.</p>
<p>He estado aprendiendo y practicando el arte de los puppets. Me topé con una gran comunidad a nivel mundial. <em>Definitivamente Jim dejó el planeta un poco mejor.</em></p>
<p>Hasta el momento he aprendido que</p>

<li>Hay diferentes tipos y cada una sirve un propósito en particular</li>
<li>Depende donde vivas, es difícil conseguirlas</li>

<li>Patrones. Los cortes para el esqueleto y el pelaje/piel depende mucho de que deseas lograr.</li>

<p>Curiosamente no me he topado con una herramienta que tome un modelo 3D y lo haga polígono para recortar. Veo una área de oportunidad para hacer un software open source para la comunidad 🥰</p>

                <p>I'm writing in my bed. It's 8:18pm. I'm listening to <a href="https://musicforprogramming.net/three"><em>Episode 03: Datassette</em></a>. I just finished some tasks with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> about a game I'm doing as a sandbox to learn the ups and downs of <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. Before that I was writing <strong>Viatorem</strong>: <em>Crystal Children. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, </em>they say. </p>
<p>I'm looking into the future of all things I'm creating and it's dawning on me... this ain't going to be easy. Nothing that I don't know already. But jeez... when you pull yourself out and see everything as a third party, <em>fork me sideways</em>.</p>
<p>To provide some context</p>
<ul>
<li>I wake up at 4:30am.</li>
<li>Prepare curcumin, moringa and green tea with cacao.</li>
<li>Slice a garlic clove to eat.</li>
<li>Sometimes I take a cold bath.</li>
<li>I start working at 5:00 am.</li>
<li>I take breaks of 20 mins.</li>
<li>I close work at 5:00 pm.</li>
<li>I take walks, in sum, I need to cover 12km which is usually around two hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>So from 7pm to 11pm is my working hours to do what I love.</p>
<p>I don't need to work a lot so I'm doing some changes so I can work from 2pm to 11pm on my stuff. <em>Discipline is your ally.</em></p>
<p>I'm lucky enough to be strict with me. Sometimes I think I enjoy suffering. In my defense, I like to push my limits whenever I can.</p>
<p><em>The expected journey is what it is: all the great things in life require sacrifices... </em>There is no escape and I'm certainly not the exception. Passion and love goes out the window as time passes.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>focus, commitment and sheer will</em> is what keeps you going... <strong><em>I</em><em>n life, love, and work...</em></strong></p>
<p><em>To the struggle 🍻</em></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><strong>SALTA</strong> (<em>or rather say ATLAS</em>) is a story about a human girl who is abandoned on a desert planet called <em><strong>Nebra. </strong></em>There's a lot about this sort of children's book but that's for the reader to hopefully enjoy while reading it. For now, I want to focus on why I have this love for muted graphic novels. FYI, I recently learnt on Reddit that they are called <em>wordless graphic novels</em>. So there's that.</p>
<p>Have you ever experienced a dialogue only through the eyes? I mean, have you ever known something just by looking someone in its eyes? I have, more than once. That kind of experience then becomes discovering why my eyes saw as if my subconscious caught it and now I'm learning what it was, you know? </p>
<p>Maybe this is only me. I have met all kinds of people with incredible skills. For me, this has been my way so far. </p>
<p>I remember when I was a kid I was very into my mind. My parents recall since an early age I never cried in front of people. They were so amazed by that because nobody taught me to do that. I just did. I didn't cry. I didn't do baby talk. I just left the room, went to a space where I'm alone and cried. After crying, I went back like nothing happened. Go figure.</p>
<p>Years happened and I went in the other direction. I started to understand that my body feels a lot, like a butt load. My parents were worried about me and how I will survive a ruthless world so certain traumas were caused. One of those traumas was not much, or at all, of physical contact. Verbal expressions of love were very little or nothing. Most of the appreciation or love, if you will, came through actions, gestures and looks.</p>
<p>One of the major events in my life was an interaction I had with my dad. I hacked his email account. He noticed that but we never talked about it. He knew I knew what's going on in his life. He was pissed obviously since I violated his privacy but we both knew he was more pissed at himself and he couldn't deal with his shame. Days passed and we didn't talk at all. No words. No gestures. No looks whatsoever. One day we were having dinner and there it was. We were across from each other. He looked at me and I looked back. And everything was said with just a second of interaction. He knew it. I knew it. And after that everything went back to normal. </p>
<p>It has been decades since that moment and I still remember the sensation like it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Maybe that's also the reason why I love languages. They have so many interesting things in them. Did you know that there is a language that depends on where the Sun is at the moment of talking? 🤯🤯🤯</p>
<p>All of that made me think the following: <em>what if language is actually a limitation? What if language is limiting the way you perceive and analyze reality? What if telepathy is actually real?</em></p>
<p>Once that idea got into my mind. I went batshit crazy. There is no other way to describe it. I literally want all my illustrated stories to be wordless. I believe that the artist (<em>hopefully me too after re-learn to draw</em>) is the medium who will translate my words into a different language. A language of images. A language that is sort of universal (assuming you have eyes to sense photons 😬😬😬). Actually, have you ever wondered what a blind-born person dreams about? They dream sounds! </p>
<p>Thus... I decided SALTA, and any future illustrated stories, will be wordless.</p>
