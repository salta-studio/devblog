I dunno how all this will be known in the future so to preserve the mystery I won't mention the <em>trinity, </em><strong>yet</strong><em>.</em></p><p class="msg msg--info"><em>Let's back up a bit.</em></p><p>I majored in theoretical physics so the following will come a bit as a red flag: I had a dread but I don't see as such but rather as the future that I will meet eventually. I have this weird believe that dreams are not necessarily simple projections of our subconscious. If telepathy is possible then we can affect our dreams too. And I do believe such thing is possible because I have learnt that consciousness is <strong><em>eternal</em></strong>.<br>I know, right? What the heck am I saying? All possible credibility you may have given me so far, it's now gone. <em>Honestly</em>, I don't blame you. It's not easy to live like this.</p><p>There is no other way to say that, <em>it is what is</em>. If you just suspense your disbelief in the name of art, maybe you will see it too.</p><p>Anyway, I had a vision of my future. I saw the books. Atlas' Saga. That's funny, though. I never intended to have more than one book. Atlas ended up been 6 books. I don't recall the exact number I dreamt but I knew in the <em>dream</em> that it was my children books. Once I had that dream I said: <em>I cannot longer postpone this. Gotta do it and gotta do it now!</em></p><p>So I embarked on the journey. I started looking for an artist to illustrate the story. Back then I haven't finished the first book, the only book I have in mind. Once I met the illustrator, a lot of strange things started to happen. It was almost like I became this <em>shaman</em> and I was channeling things from another dimension. I started to dream again. I don't usually dream (<em>hmm that's why I give dreams so much weight</em>). For the purpose of protecting the future, I won't say what those dreams were about. All I can say it's a lot and <em>they are influencing all my work.</em></p><p>So, I started to get all these thoughts and visions, <em>if you will.</em> I saw what Atlas' journey will become. And thus, 6 books were born.Â </p><p>I finished the first book even before the time I was expecting to and then 2 months later I finished all 6 books. I was,<em> in other words</em>, on fire! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p><p>After a few dreams I concludedÂ that<em> Viatorem, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong><strong>'</strong> character,Â </em>will be involve in Atlas' Saga.</p><p>As a gift to <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em><strong><em>,</em> </strong><em>and for the other reason too</em>, I decided that <strong>Viatorem</strong> will be my long-run project for decades to come. I had this story called <strong><em>The Last Inuit</em> </strong>(<em>which is my nickname <strong>thelastinuit</strong></em>). It was about a bunch of scientists, artists and philosophers that escape Earth and travel throughout the cosmos having space adventures and whatnot. I never finished that story, though. Viatorem revived that dream and so the reason to take over <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em><em><strong>'</strong></em> character.</p><p>Now, what the heck all this has to do with <strong>trinity</strong>, anyway? Well, a lot. You see, there is this meta-dimension called <em><strong>Crystal Children</strong>. </em>It's the only thing that's actually real. The rest of things are just meta-projections of all those <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong>. <em>There is one and only one <strong>abstraction</strong></em>. To avoid spoilers, if any, I will not mention that <strong><em>abstraction</em></strong> name. Nonetheless, I can say that that abstraction became 3 <em><strong>abstractions.</strong></em> Or, in other words, <em>reality is a relation</em>.</p><p>Those 3 <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong> play games and dance around. They are all around but most of the time we don't see them because, well, we are <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong> too. the way it works, <em>AFAICT,</em> is a bit chaotic. I'll say this, though: <em>everything is nothing and vice versa.</em> When you understand that, or rather just accept/believe that, you can see reality as it is. <em>There is no spoon</em>.</p><p>All <em><strong>I'm</strong></em> doing therefore is being the instrument that allows those <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong> to manifest (<em>stories</em>) and <em><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">koimoons</a></strong></em><em><strong>Â </strong></em>is the one who, well, illustrate <strong>them</strong>.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><em>If you pay attention, that last phrase says it all about those 3 <strong>abstractions</strong>... </em>ðŸ¤­</p><p>Â </p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">@2025<script data-name="BMC-Widget" data-cfasync="false" src="https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js" data-id="he.and.her" data-description="Support me on Buy me a coffee!" data-message="" data-color="#BD5FFF" data-position="Right" data-x_margin="18" data-y_margin="18"></script></div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
