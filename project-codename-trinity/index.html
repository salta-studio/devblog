I dunno how all this will be known in the future so to preserve the mystery I won't mention the <em>trinity, </em><strong>yet</strong><em>.</em></p><p class="msg msg--info"><em>Let's back up a bit.</em></p><p>I majored in theoretical physics so the following will come a bit as a red flag: I had a dread but I don't see as such but rather as the future that I will meet eventually. I have this weird believe that dreams are not necessarily simple projects of our subconscious. If telepathy is possible then we can affect our dreams too. And I do believe such thing is possible because I have learnt that consciousness is eternal.<br>I know, right? What the heck am I saying? All possible credibility you may have given me now is gone. Honestly, I don't blame you.</p><p>There is no other way to say that, it is what is. If you just suspense your disbelief in the name of art, maybe you will understand it.</p><p>Anyway, I had a vision of my future. I saw the books. Atlas' Saga. That's funny, though. I never intended to have more than one book. Atlas ended up been 6 books. I don't recall the exact number I dreamt but I knew in the <em>dream</em> that it was my children books. Once I had that dream I said: <em>I cannot longer postpone this. Gotta do it and gotta do it now!</em></p><p>So I embarked on the journey. I started looking for an artist to illustrated the story. Back then I haven't finished the first book and only book. Once I met the illustrator (<strong><em>koimoons</em></strong>), a lot of strange things happened. It was almost like I became this shaman. I started to dream again. I don't usually dream (perhaps that's why I give dreams so much weight). For the purpose of protecting the future, I won't say what those dreams I have provided me. All I can say is a lot and they are influencing all my work.</p><p>While I was talking to <strong><em>koimoons</em></strong>, I started to get all these thoughts and visions, if you will. Maybe I'm crazy and I daydream a lot. It doesn't matter. I started to see more on Atlas' journey. I had one book and suddenly it was 6 books.Â </p><p>I finished the first book even before the time I was expecting and then 2 month later I finished all 6 books. I was, in other words, on fire!</p><p>While talking to <strong><em>koimoonsÂ </em></strong>and knowing more about her and her artistic creation I came to the conclusion that<em> Viatorem, <strong>koimoons'</strong> character,Â </em>it had to be involve in Atlas' Saga. Two reason, one, I feel so in debt with <em><strong>koimoons '</strong></em>cuz she has managed to create the perfect visualization of Atlas. I cannot conceive how she managed that. I have this theory that humans are like antennas so perhaps it was meant to be (<em>honestly, without much detail, it was... dreams but that's story I cannot tell... yet and not here</em>).</p><p>As a gift to <strong><em>koimoons</em> </strong>and for other reasons too I decided that Viatorem will be my long-run project for decades to come. I had this story called <strong><em>The Last Inuit</em> </strong>(<em>which is my nickname thelastinuit</em>). It was about a bunch of scientists, artists and philosophers that escape Earth and travel the cosmos having space adventures. I never finished that story and Viatorem revived that dream hence the reason to take over <em><strong>koimoons'</strong></em> character.</p><p>Now, what the heck all this has to do with trinity, anyway? Well, a lot. You see, there is this meta-dimension called <em>Crystal Children. </em>It's the only thing that's actually real. The rest of things are just meta-projections of all those abstractions. There is one and only one abstraction. To avoid spoilers, if any, I will not mention that abstraction is. Nonetheless, I can say that that abstractions became 3, in other words, <em>reality is a relation</em>.</p><p>Those 3 abstractions play games and dance around. They are all around but most of the time we don't see them because, well, we are abstractions too. the way it works is a bit chaotic. I'll say this: <em>everything is nothing and vice versa.</em> When you understand that or rather just accept/believe that you can see the reality that is hidden from us.</p><p>All <em><strong>I'm</strong></em> doing therefore is being the instrument that allows those abstractions to manifest (stories) and <em><strong>koimoons </strong></em>is the one who illustrate <strong>them</strong>.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><em>If you pay attention that last phrase says it all about those 3 abstractions... </em>ðŸ¤­</p><p>Â </p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">@2025</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
