It's easier to be cynical about it but in retrospective I don't blame my parents, they were too young to know what to do.<em> Does anyone of any change know what to do to be a good parent?</em></p>\n<p>I was a sensible kid. Very sensible kid. There were times were I cried and crouched like a baby because of the pain. I don't think it was a physical pain but for some reason that's how my body reacted. I was not an effeminate kid but I was quite sensible. My dad noticed that. In his defense, he saw a kid who clearly would be eaten by the world. So he did he thought best. He tried to make me a man in ways that clearly didn't work. It only made me feel a shame of myself. I wanted to learn to dance like a ballerina. My great grand mother was a famous ballerina in the early 1900s. She travelled the world and such and such. But for a kid to do that and knowing what I was, he, well, didn't allowed that. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/IMG_6115.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-md.webp 768w\"></figure>The years past. Only my grand mother let me be. I grew as a kid who couldn't be himself for most of time among other issue. </p>\n<p>I tried to draw and that was alright. I did for years. But something inside me was dying. It's been hmm more than a decade since I haven't drawn anything. During college I made music. Not fancy music but good enough for me. </p>\n<p>I remember that at some point I gave a friend a gift. I wrapped it up with my last drawings. To me they were normal. But for him, he found them fascinating. He framed one of the drawings. It is as we speak hanging in his apartment. I never thought <em>my art</em> would be part of personal art gallery of anybody 🥺🥺🥺</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/IMG_6116.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6116-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6116-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6116-md.webp 768w\"></figure>Around those years I tried to make a studio but clearly I failed since I knew shit of managing, leadership or anything. I just wanted a place to create my stuff. Since then I stopped being artistic in any way. No music, no drawings, no dancing.</p>\n<p>I honestly don't know what happened inside me. I tried for a second time to create a sort of a studio but more flexible and such. But the issues the economy (<em>and someone else</em>), I run out of money.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have a video call with a friend who happens to also be writing children books. After that talk I felt I needed to go back to my roots. There are other major reasons but, for respect to the person involved, I can't say more.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying I was good at anything. I'm merely saying that I had something in me that allow to draw, dance and make music and it got lost. I lost it. I blame no one.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/IMG_6113.png\" alt=\"Ishmael\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6113-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6113-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6113-md.webp 768w\"></figure>Anyway, I'm back. I've been doodling daily. I need to go back. This time, though, I 'm aiming high: I want to find a way to illustrate as far as I can get close to the lord and master <a href=\"https://www.moebius.fr/\"><strong>Moebiüs</strong></a> style. I need that for my projects. Obviously, I don't want to be like him or draw like him but similar beautiful landscape with my own style.</p>\n<p>I have no idea how what I will accomplish. I'm certainly crazy in wanting my projects to succeed when I'm mostly alone and rusty skills but hey the impossibility of things has never been an impediment for <em>moi.</em></p>",

I'm more like an observant, a very curious person. I'm not interested in being judgemental but rather know more about anything. When it comes to writing or any creative process, my way to go is to be surrounded by things that project you into those scenarios.</p>\n<p>I just realized that I have become, in a way, <strong><em>Viatorem</em></strong>. I think that's why I fell in love with that character. I'm in my house at 6am working with Lola, a tiny bunny. I recently pierced my ears again and the design I chose is like a representation of hey eyes. I started to see my home as a spaceship. In the afternoons, I take a break and start dancing in the open space I have. <em><strong>Viatorem</strong>'s</em> adventure will always start with a song and her dancing in her spaceship. I'm living in a desert city and I love the desert.</p>\n<p>I have in front of me, for lack of a better word, a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, I intentionally but also subconsciously did it.</p>\n<p>What I find very interesting is that <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>was not my creation. She was created by <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">koimoons</a></strong></em>. Now I find myself not being able to live without her. Don't get me wrong. I love <strong>Atlas</strong>' story. I created her. She's in my room as we speak but <strong><em>Viatorem</em> </strong>seems to fulfill a very old dream: <strong>to travel the Cosmos and have space adventures</strong>, <em>my own personal space opera</em>.</p>\n<p>I'm grateful for what my life has become especially with this forsaken global situation.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">✨✨✨<br>🌌🌌🌌</p>\n</div>",

I have met all kinds of people with incredible skills. For me, this has been my way so far. </p>\n<p>I remember when I was a kid I was very into my mind. My parents recall since an early age I never cried in front of people. They were so amazed by that because nobody taught me to do that. I just did. I didn't cry. I didn't do baby talk. I just left the room, went to a space where I'm alone and cried. After crying, I went back like nothing happened.

I started to understand that my body feels a lot, like a butt load. My parents were worried about me and how I will survive a ruthless world so certain traumas were caused. One of those traumas was not much, or at all, of physical contact. Verbal expressions of love were very little or nothing. Most of the appreciation or love, if you will, came through actions, gestures and looks.</p>\n<p>One of the major events in my life was an interaction I had with my dad. I hacked his email account. He noticed that but we never talked about it. He knew I knew what's going on in his life. He was pissed obviously since I violated his privacy but we both knew he was more pissed at himself and he couldn't deal with his shame. Days passed and we didn't talk at all. No words. No gestures. No looks whatsoever. One day we were having dinner and there it was. We were across from each other. He looked at me and I looked back. And everything was said with just a second of interaction. He knew it. I knew it. And after that everything went back to normal. </p>\n<p>It has been decades since that moment and I still remember the sensation like it was yesterday.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"margin-bottom: 1.37143rem; margin-right: 1.37143rem; outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.55) !important;\" src=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/3/5e8541fb-4f5e-440d-a3d2-dcaeb4d057a0.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1341\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/3/responsive/5e8541fb-4f5e-440d-a3d2-dcaeb4d057a0-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/3/responsive/5e8541fb-4f5e-440d-a3d2-dcaeb4d057a0-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/3/responsive/5e8541fb-4f5e-440d-a3d2-dcaeb4d057a0-md.webp 768w\"></figure>\n<p>Maybe that's also the reason why I love languages. They have so many interesting things in them. Did you know that there is a language that depends on where the Sun is at the moment of talking? 🤯🤯🤯</p>\n<p>All of that made me think the following: <em>what if language is actually a limitation? What if language is limiting the way you perceive and analyze reality? What if telepathy is actually real?</em></p>\n<p>Once that idea got into my mind. I went batshit crazy. There is no other way to describe it. I literally want all my illustrated stories to be wordless. I believe that the artist (<em>hopefully me too after re-learn to draw</em>) is the medium who will translate my words into a different language. A language of images. A language that is sort of universal (assuming you have eyes to sense photons 😬😬😬). Actually, have you ever wondered what a blind-born person dreams about? They dream sounds! </p>\n<p>Thus... I decided SALTA, and any future illustrated stories, will be wordless.</p>",
