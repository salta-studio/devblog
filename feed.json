The trip itself was amazing. What blew my mind was the two lights over the sky and the beings that visited us.</p>\n<p>Actually, it was two stories. One was an ancient gazette in the times of the Aztec Empire. It was a comic about the lives of women during the empire. The inspiration came when I saw a lot of women in the spiritual trip, suffering. The issue was mostly, us, men. That project is still on hold. I'm waiting for the right moment to start it. </p>\n<p>The other project was <strong>Teteo. </strong>It's about a child who becomes a god by the teaching of her 'Ama. After watching those women, I sort of came to the conclusion that us men are not men. Not to blame anyone but nowadays there is no men initiation: <em>to face death and  become one with your tribe. </em></p>\n<p>I happen to believe the initiation is necessary to become a better man for yourself and the community. With such technological advancement, I don't see any progress in that. </p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to face death and learnt from it at an early age and also to go to therapy and even so I made a lot of mistakes and caused a lot of suffering to my female companions.</p>\n<p><strong>Teteo </strong>is a story of how a child becomes a god through the process of balancing his archetypes: <em>King, Warrior, Magician </em>and<em> Lover. </em>The final lesson is her 'Ama's death.</p>\n<p><strong>Teteo</strong> now is over when it comes to writing. All I need is the illustration.</p>",

Very sensible kid. There were times were I cried and crouched like a baby because of the pain. I don't think it was a physical pain but for some reason that's how my body reacted. I was not an effeminate kid but I was quite sensible. My dad noticed that. In his defense, he saw a kid who clearly would be eaten by the world. So he did he thought best. He tried to make me a man in ways that clearly didn't work. It only made me feel a shame of myself. I wanted to learn to dance like a ballerina. My great grand mother was a famous ballerina in the early 1900s. She travelled the world and such and such. But for a kid to do that and knowing what I was, he, well, didn't allowed that. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/IMG_6115.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-xs.webp 300w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-sm.webp 480w ,https://salta-studio.github.io/devblog/media/posts/12/responsive/IMG_6115-md.webp 768w\"></figure>The years past.

Not fancy music but good enough for me. </p>\n<p>I remember that at some point I gave a friend a gift. I wrapped it up with my last drawings. To me they were normal.

I tried for a second time to create a sort of a studio but more flexible and such. But the issues the economy (<em>and someone else</em>), I run out of money.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have a video call with a friend who happens to also be writing children books.

It asked me to be patience, that it will come.</p>\n<p>Those reading happened after, <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/koimoons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">koimoons</a></strong></em>, the <em>illustrator, </em>so I knew it wasn't her.</p>\n<p>Why is that impressive? Well, it also said that it will be someone from my past 😨😨😨</p>\n<p>At those moments, I could thought of anyone.</p>\n<p>Weeks past, and nothing. But I needed to be patience, it said or rather I understood that.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, finally, I have a casual meeting with a friend. He's living in Brooklyn now. He is one of those artistic people I admire so much. I don't know why I didn't think of him before. In my defense, I think I didn't think of him 'cuz he's always doing something artistic plus work. Internally, I guess I knew he wouldn't have the time.</p>\n<p>Lo and behold, we now have every Sunday meeting of what we called <em>Creative Anonymous Support Group.</em> He is also writing children books!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">😳😳😳<br>🤯🤯🤯</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>I'm so happy for this support. I really needed. It's like traveling the Cosmos totally alone and it feels nice that through intercom there is something in the Cosmos doing something similar.</em></p>",
